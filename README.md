# Scraping Bundesliga Data in Python

In this Jupyter notebook we scrape Bundesliga data using Python and Beautiful Soup and do some quick analysis in Pandas. The script iterates over a number of different Bundesliga seasons and generates a usable Pandas dataframe for analysis.

## Project Motivation
In this analysis we use Python and Beautiful to explore Bundesliga scores. The analysis is secondary to the exploration of Beautifulsoup and how to scrape websites.

It also seeks to answers which teams have won most seasons and how many goals have been scored. 

## File Descriptions
The script uses the Skysports website for the data.
